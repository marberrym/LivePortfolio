#### Table of Contents
   
This portfolio has been a very interesting project for me to work on.  It has been an opportunity for me to both showcase my skills and also build my online presence and identity.  When building this website I had two main components I wanted to focus on:

###### 1.  Portfolio Landing Page
  * I wanted a page that showcased both my programing skills and my abilities in regards to design.
  * I wanted a page that accurately conveyed who I am as a person and the things that I value.

###### 2.  Building a Blog to Link to from my Landing Page
  * I wanted a blog that looked beautiful aesthetically with a name and message that suited me.
  * I wanted to have a blog that focused on some key areas of my life:
     * Coding - A place where I can document my journey into developing myself as a software engineer.
     * Lifestyle - A place where I can share my personal lifestyle and views with others in a constructive manner.
     * Projects - A place where I can showcase current projects I am working on, both inside and outside of tech.
     * Resume - Another place where I can showcase my resume and recieve feedback on it.
     * About - A page where I could share with others my views behind LHM and why I believe in that cause.
